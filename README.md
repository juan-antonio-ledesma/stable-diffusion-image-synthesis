# Stable Diffusion Â· Image Synthesis

This repository showcases a collection of images generated through Stable Diffusion. Each image is accompanied by its corresponding model and prompt. I hope you enjoy them.

Stable Diffusion is a deep learning, text-to-image model released in 2022 based on diffusion techniques. It is primarily used to generate detailed images conditioned on text descriptions, though it can also be applied to other tasks such as inpainting, outpainting, and generating image-to-image translations guided by a text prompt.
